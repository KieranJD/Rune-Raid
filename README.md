# Rune-Raid
Sixth Form Individual Programming Project

Aim:
- To create a multi-level puzzle/adventure 2D platform game within the Unity Engine, where each player competes to obtain the fastest timed level completion, to get their name on the leaderboards.

Outcome:
- Rune Raid consisted of 3 fully functional puzzle levels, which got progressively harder as the player progressed through the game.
- Each level was challenging and interactive for the player.
- If the player completed a level in a time that deserved a place on one of the leaderboards, then their username and time where listed accordingly.
